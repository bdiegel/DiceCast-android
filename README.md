# DiceCast
A "Google Castâ„¢ Ready" dice roller for Android. 

# CastCompanionLibrary
This project uses the [CastCompanionLibrary](https://github.com/googlecast/CastCompanionLibrary-android),
a wrapper around the Cast SDK that reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed by an 
application to provide basic casting.
 
Have a look at some basic cast examples that do not use CCL:

* The sample application [CastHelloText-android](https://github.com/googlecast/CastHelloText-android.git)
* The DiceCast MainActivity prior to integrating CCL [v1.0.0](https://github.com/bdiegel/DiceCast-android/blob/v1.0.0/app/src/main/java/com/honu/dicecast/MainActivity.java) 

# Project Setup
This is an Android Studio project. The gradle build has an **external** dependency on the Android 
library project [CastCompanionLibrary](https://github.com/googlecast/CastCompanionLibrary-android).
See settings.gradle and build.gradle for details of how this dependency is configured.

The structure of the working directory:

  1. create a directory that will hold both projects and cd into it
  2. git clone [https://github.com/bdiegel/DiceCast-android.git]()
  3. git clone [https://github.com/googlecast/CastCompanionLibrary-android]() CastCompanionLibrary   
   **OR**   
   git clone [https://github.com/bdiegel/CastCompanionLibrary-android.git]() CastCompanionLibrary

My fork of CCL uses an updated GMS Play Services SDK and Support Library, providing updated Cast icons.
