### About
DiceCast demonstrates how to use the Cast API for non-media based application development. It is a basic sender
application that communicates with the receiver application using a custom channel. It was developed
before the ability to cast your Android screen was available.

### CastCompanionLibrary
This project uses the [CastCompanionLibrary](https://github.com/googlecast/CastCompanionLibrary-android),
a wrapper around the Cast SDK that reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed by an 
application to provide basic casting.
 
Have a look at some basic cast examples that do not use CCL:

* The sample application [CastHelloText-android](https://github.com/googlecast/CastHelloText-android.git)
* The DiceCast MainActivity prior to integrating CCL [v1.0.0](https://github.com/bdiegel/DiceCast-android/blob/v1.0.0/app/src/main/java/com/honu/dicecast/MainActivity.java) 

### Project Setup
This is an Android Studio project. The default build setup has no external dependencies.

You can also build the CCL library yourself from the project [CastCompanionLibrary](https://github.com/googlecast/CastCompanionLibrary-android).
See settings.gradle and build.gradle for details of how this dependency is configured.

The structure of the working directory:

  1. create a directory that will hold both projects and cd into it
  2. git clone [https://github.com/bdiegel/DiceCast-android.git]()
  3. git clone [https://github.com/googlecast/CastCompanionLibrary-android]() CastCompanionLibrary
